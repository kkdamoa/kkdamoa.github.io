# Discover Gangneung - A Guide to Gyeongpo Beach and Anmok Beach

Gangneung, located on Korea’s east coast, is a favorite destination for beach lovers and coffee enthusiasts alike. Known for its beautiful beaches, cultural sites, and relaxed vibe, Gangneung offers a unique blend of natural beauty and modern comfort. Two of the most popular spots here are **Gyeongpo Beach** (경포대) and **Anmok Beach** (안목해변). Here’s a guide to experiencing the best of both beaches.

## Gyeongpo Beach - A Classic Korean Beach Experience

### Scenic Views and Activities at Gyeongpo Beach
**Gyeongpo Beach** is one of the longest and most scenic beaches on Korea’s east coast. Stretching 6 kilometers along the clear waters of the East Sea, it’s a perfect place for swimming, sunbathing, and seaside strolls. The sandy beach is lined with pine trees, providing a beautiful natural backdrop and shady spots for a break from the sun.

In summer, Gyeongpo Beach is lively with beachgoers and festivals, while in winter, it offers a peaceful retreat with serene ocean views. This beach is ideal for those looking for a classic Korean beach experience with plenty of facilities, including showers, changing rooms, and nearby cafes and restaurants.

### Gyeongpodae Pavilion - A Historic Landmark by the Beach
Just a short walk from Gyeongpo Beach, you’ll find the historic **Gyeongpodae Pavilion**. This iconic pavilion was built during the Joseon Dynasty and offers beautiful views of **Gyeongpo Lake** and the surrounding scenery. Known for its reflection of the moon on the lake’s surface, Gyeongpodae Pavilion is one of Gangneung’s must-see cultural landmarks.

Visitors often come here in the early morning or evening to enjoy the peaceful ambiance and take in the lake views. The pavilion is a popular photo spot, especially during cherry blossom season in spring, when the surrounding trees are in full bloom.

### Cycling and Walking Paths Around Gyeongpo Lake
Gyeongpo Beach is located near **Gyeongpo Lake**, which has well-maintained cycling and walking paths that circle the lake. You can rent a bike near the beach and take a leisurely ride around the lake while enjoying views of cherry blossoms in spring or vibrant autumn foliage. The path is scenic and perfect for an afternoon activity with friends or family.

## Anmok Beach - Korea’s Famous “Coffee Beach”

### Coffee Street - A Paradise for Coffee Lovers
**Anmok Beach** has earned the nickname “Coffee Beach” due to its famous **Coffee Street**. Lining the shore, this street is filled with coffee shops, each offering a variety of unique brews and delicious desserts. From local coffee roasters to popular franchises, there’s something for every coffee lover on Coffee Street. Many of the cafes are designed with large windows and outdoor seating, allowing visitors to enjoy coffee with a view of the ocean.

My personal favorite was sitting by the window of a second-floor café, sipping an iced Americano and watching the waves crash onto the shore. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the sea breeze created a perfect blend of relaxation and refreshment. Visiting Anmok Beach’s Coffee Street is a unique experience that combines coffee culture with the tranquility of the sea.

### Beach and Ocean Views at Anmok Beach
Anmok Beach itself is more laid-back compared to Gyeongpo, with a smaller stretch of sand and a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. This beach is perfect for those who want to enjoy the ocean views while avoiding large crowds. Many people come to Anmok Beach to unwind, enjoy the coffee scene, and take a peaceful walk along the shore.

In the evening, the beach becomes especially romantic as the lights from the coffee shops reflect on the water, creating a warm and inviting ambiance. It’s the perfect place to wind down and enjoy a slow-paced afternoon or evening by the sea.
