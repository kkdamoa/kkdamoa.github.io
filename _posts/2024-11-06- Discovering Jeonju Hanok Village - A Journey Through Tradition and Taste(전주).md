# Discovering Jeonju Hanok Village - A Journey Through Tradition and Taste

**Jeonju Hanok Village** is a place that feels almost magical, with its beautifully preserved traditional Korean houses, winding alleys, and vibrant culture. Located in Jeonju, a city known for its rich history and culinary delights, the village transports visitors back to the Joseon Dynasty. My day at Jeonju Hanok Village was filled with exploration, delicious food, and cultural experiences. Here’s a guide to making the most of your visit!

## Morning - First Impressions and Exploring Hanok Architecture

I arrived in Jeonju Hanok Village in the morning, excited to start the day. The first thing that struck me was the charm of **hanok** houses. These traditional Korean homes, with their curved tiled roofs, wooden frames, and elegant simplicity, lined the village streets. The village has over 800 hanoks, each one preserved to showcase the beauty of Korean architecture.

I wandered down **Omokdae Street**, a popular path in the village. It was like stepping back in time, with locals and visitors dressed in **hanbok** (traditional Korean clothing). The rental shops here offer various styles, so I decided to join in and rent a hanbok. Strolling through the village in traditional attire made me feel even more immersed in the experience and added a touch of authenticity to my photos.

## Mid-Morning - Visiting Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Omokdae Pavilion

One of the most significant sites in the village is the **Gyeonggijeon Shrine**, built in 1410. This shrine houses the portrait of **King Taejo**, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty. Walking through the shrine’s large gates and peaceful courtyards, I felt a deep sense of history. The grounds are beautifully maintained, with tall trees and open spaces that create a serene atmosphere. Inside, the exhibit details the history of King Taejo and the shrine’s importance to Korean heritage.

From there, I took a short walk up to **Omokdae Pavilion**, which offers a panoramic view of Jeonju Hanok Village. The pavilion is set on a small hill, and the sight of hanok rooftops stretching across the village below is breathtaking. It’s a great spot to sit, take photos, and appreciate the blend of history and natural beauty.

## Noon - A Culinary Journey with Jeonju Bibimbap

After all the walking and exploring, I was ready for lunch. Jeonju is famous for its **bibimbap**, and there’s no better place to try this dish than in its hometown. I headed to a local restaurant that came highly recommended and ordered a bowl of Jeonju-style bibimbap.

Jeonju bibimbap is special because it’s made with local ingredients, including fresh vegetables, seasoned beef, a raw egg yolk, and **gochujang** (red chili paste). The colors and flavors were as vibrant as the village itself. Mixing everything together created a harmony of textures and tastes that was incredibly satisfying. For food lovers, Jeonju Hanok Village is a dream, with local specialties like **kongnamul gukbap** (bean sprout soup) and **makgeolli** (Korean rice wine) to sample as well.

## Afternoon - Experiencing Traditional Crafts and Arts

One of the highlights of my day was visiting the craft workshops and shops scattered throughout the village. **Jeonju Hanok Village** is known for its traditional **hanji** (Korean paper) art, and several workshops offer classes where you can learn to make your own hanji crafts. I joined a hanji workshop and made a small lantern using the delicate paper, which was a fun and memorable hands-on experience.

Next, I explored shops selling handmade crafts like pottery, wooden masks, and hanbok accessories. I found some beautiful **souvenirs**, including a handmade fan and a small piece of pottery, each a unique reminder of my time here. Many shops in Jeonju are family-owned, and the artisans are often happy to share the stories behind their work.

## Late Afternoon - Traditional Tea Houses and Jeonju’s Street Food

As the afternoon light softened, I decided to visit a traditional tea house for a break. Tea houses in Jeonju Hanok Village are typically set in hanok buildings, with floor seating and wooden interiors. I ordered **omija-cha** (five-flavor berry tea) and enjoyed the quiet ambiance as I watched the world go by. The tea, both sweet and slightly tart, was refreshing and complemented the relaxed pace of the village.

After tea, I headed out to explore the street food stalls, which offer an array of tasty snacks. Jeonju’s street food scene is well-known for unique treats like **choco pie** (a chocolate-filled pastry), **tteok-galbi** (grilled short rib patties), and **moju** (a sweet, low-alcohol drink made with herbs and rice wine). The warm choco pie was especially delicious, with a rich chocolate center that paired perfectly with the crisp exterior. Street food in Jeonju Hanok Village is an experience of its own, with each bite offering a taste of local flavor.

## Evening - Capturing the Village at Dusk

As evening approached, the village took on a new charm. The lanterns along the streets began to glow, casting a warm light over the hanoks and creating a beautiful, peaceful atmosphere. I walked back to Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Omokdae Pavilion to capture the village at dusk, taking in the serene vibe as the day came to a close. Watching the sun set over the hanoks was a perfect way to wrap up my day.

## Final Tips for Visiting Jeonju Hanok Village

1. **Dress in Hanbok**: It’s worth renting a hanbok to get the full experience, and many hanbok rental shops offer a variety of styles to choose from.
2. **Join a Workshop**: Whether it’s hanji-making, pottery, or calligraphy, participating in a craft workshop adds a hands-on element to your visit.
3. **Try Local Foods**: Don’t leave without tasting Jeonju’s famous bibimbap, as well as the delicious street foods unique to the village.
4. **Plan for the Evening**: Jeonju Hanok Village is beautiful at any time, but the village at dusk has a special charm that’s worth staying to see.

Jeonju Hanok Village is a place where tradition and modern-day life coexist harmoniously. With its cultural depth, vibrant food scene, and artistic spirit, it’s a must-visit destination for anyone looking to experience Korea’s rich heritage. I left with not only photos and souvenirs, but a sense of connection to Korea’s past that made the visit truly unforgettable.
