## Discovering the Tripitaka Koreana - A National Treasure

### The Tripitaka Koreana (Palman Daejanggyeong)

The wooden blocks are stored in **Janggyeong Panjeon**, a specially designed building within Haeinsa Temple that uses natural ventilation and climate control to protect the blocks from humidity and decay.
