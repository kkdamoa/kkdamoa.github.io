# Nami Island - A Magical Getaway Through Nature and Culture

My trip to **Nami Island** was like stepping into a fairytale. Located just an hour or so from Seoul, Nami Island is famous for its beautiful tree-lined paths, seasonal landscapes, and unique cultural experiences. I’d seen so many photos of it before going, but being there in person was an entirely different experience. Here’s how my day unfolded on this small but enchanting island.

## Arrival - Getting to Nami Island and the Ferry Ride

To get to Nami Island, I took a train from Seoul to Gapyeong Station, followed by a quick taxi ride to the ferry terminal. As soon as I got off the train, I could feel the fresh air and a change of pace from the busy city. When I arrived at the ferry terminal, I bought a ticket that included both the ferry ride and entrance to the island.

The ferry ride was short—just five minutes—but it set the mood. The boat slowly approached the island, and I caught glimpses of tall trees and colorful foliage along the shore. Nami Island is an independent “republic” with its own passport, which you can even get stamped as a fun souvenir.

## Morning - First Impressions and Exploring the Island Paths

The first thing I did was head toward the iconic **Metasequoia Tree Lane**. Walking down this path lined with tall, straight trees felt almost surreal, as if I had entered a scene from a movie (and indeed, many dramas have been filmed here). The air was fresh, and with each step, I felt more at ease.

Nami Island is famous for its seasonal changes. I visited in autumn, and the colors were stunning—reds, oranges, and yellows everywhere. But I heard that spring is also beautiful with cherry blossoms, and winter brings a magical, snow-covered landscape. Each season seems to give the island a new personality.

## Mid-Morning - Discovering Art Installations and Korean Drama Spots

Nami Island has a quirky side, too. As I walked around, I discovered various art installations, sculptures, and even whimsical signs. Each one seemed to blend naturally with the landscape. My favorite was a series of small, brightly colored cottages and a statue called **Snowman Family**, which added a bit of fun to the otherwise serene atmosphere.

For K-drama fans, Nami Island is a dream. It’s especially known for being featured in the drama **Winter Sonata**. There’s a small “Winter Sonata” statue dedicated to the drama’s famous couple, and walking by that spot, I could see why it was chosen as a filming location. The quiet, romantic ambiance is perfect for a stroll, whether you’re alone or with someone special.

## Noon - Enjoying Lunch and Local Snacks

I got hungry around noon and stopped at a local cafe near the **Central Korean Pine Tree Lane**. There are several options for food on the island, ranging from traditional Korean dishes to international options. I decided to try **dakgalbi** (spicy stir-fried chicken) at a small restaurant with a cozy, rustic vibe. It was the perfect dish to warm me up after my morning walk, and the flavors were rich and satisfying.

After lunch, I couldn’t resist trying some of the local snacks from street vendors. One standout was the **hotteok** (sweet, stuffed pancake), which was warm, gooey, and sweet—just the energy boost I needed to keep exploring. There were also other snacks like **bbopki** (Korean candy) and roasted sweet potatoes, all adding to the island’s charm.

## Afternoon - Biking Around the Island and Riverside Views

In the afternoon, I rented a bike to cover more ground. Nami Island is the perfect size for a leisurely bike ride, and there are bike rental shops conveniently located near the main entrance. Riding along the river, with the trees on one side and the water on the other, was a highlight of my day. I stopped multiple times just to take in the view and snap some photos.

At one point, I reached the **Ginkgo Tree Lane**, where the ground was covered in bright yellow leaves. The whole scene was picture-perfect, and I could see why so many people recommended biking here. It’s easy to explore on foot too, but the bike allowed me to see more of the island in a shorter time.

## Late Afternoon - Finding Peace at Riverside Picnic Areas

Toward the end of the day, I found a quiet picnic area by the riverside. Many people were sitting on blankets, enjoying a snack, or just relaxing. Nami Island’s riverside areas are peaceful, with ducks swimming by and birds chirping in the trees. I took a moment to simply sit and appreciate the beauty around me. Even though I was only a short distance from the city, I felt like I was in a different world.

## Evening - Catching the Ferry Back and Final Impressions

As the day wound down, I made my way back to the ferry terminal. The sunset was casting a golden glow over the trees, making it the perfect end to a magical day. The ferry ride back felt bittersweet, as I wasn’t quite ready to leave, but I knew I’d be back someday. Nami Island is the kind of place that stays with you long after you leave.

## Tips for Visiting Nami Island

1. **Visit during a weekday if possible** - The island can get quite crowded on weekends, especially during peak seasons.
2. **Plan for the season** - Each season offers a different experience, so check what to expect for the time of year you’ll be visiting.
3. **Rent a bike** - It’s a fun and convenient way to see the island, and there are tandem bikes if you’re with someone else.
4. **Bring a camera** - Nami Island is incredibly photogenic, so you’ll want to capture the beautiful scenery.

Nami Island is more than just a popular tourist spot; it’s a place that invites you to slow down, breathe, and enjoy the natural beauty around you. Whether you’re a nature lover, a K-drama fan, or just looking for a peaceful getaway, Nami Island offers something special for everyone.
