# Exploring Suwon Hwaseong Fortress - A Day of History, Adventure, and Scenic Views

When I set out for **Suwon Hwaseong Fortress**, I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, but this UNESCO World Heritage site in Suwon turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences of my trip to Korea. If you're planning a visit, here’s a rundown of how I spent my day exploring this incredible place, along with a few tips to help you make the most of your time there.

## Morning - Getting to Hwaseong and First Impressions

My journey started with a train ride from Seoul to Suwon Station, which took about 30 minutes on the subway. From there, I grabbed a local bus to reach Hwaseong Fortress. As I arrived, the first thing that struck me was the sheer scale of the fortress. Enclosing a large portion of Suwon, the walls stretched out before me, weaving through the city with impressive stone gates and watchtowers popping up at intervals.

I picked up a ticket at the entrance (you can get a combination ticket if you plan to see other nearby attractions like the Hwaseong Haenggung Palace), and I was ready to dive into history.

## Mid-Morning - Walking Along the Fortress Wall

Hwaseong Fortress is over 5.7 kilometers long, and there are multiple paths you can take to explore it. I started by heading up to the **Paldalmun Gate**, which is a major landmark and one of the main gates of the fortress. Walking along the fortress wall was like taking a journey back in time. The views of Suwon city from up there were stunning, with modern buildings on one side and ancient fortress walls on the other.

As I continued along the wall, I passed by several watchtowers and artillery bastions. One of my favorite spots was **Seojangdae** (the Western Command Post). It’s perched high up and offers one of the best panoramic views of the entire fortress and the surrounding area. I took a moment to rest here, enjoying the breeze and snapping a few photos. The fortress walls are well-preserved, and every stone seemed to tell a story of the city’s past.

## Noon - Exploring Hwaseong Haenggung Palace

By noon, I was ready to take a break from the walk, so I made my way to **Hwaseong Haenggung Palace**, located within the fortress grounds. This palace was once used as a temporary residence by King Jeongjo, the ruler who had the fortress built in the late 18th century. It’s not as grand as the palaces in Seoul, but there’s something charming and serene about it.

The palace had several traditional Korean buildings, with colorful roofs and wooden structures arranged in a spacious courtyard. I joined a small tour group, which helped me understand the history of each building. My favorite part? A hall filled with exhibits on King Jeongjo’s life and the construction of Hwaseong Fortress – a fascinating look into why he built such an impressive structure here in Suwon.

## Afternoon - Trying the Hwaseong Trolley and Archery

After lunch at a local restaurant just outside the fortress (tip: try the famous Suwon galbi!), I noticed a cute, old-fashioned **Hwaseong Trolley** passing by. The trolley is a great way to see the fortress without all the walking, especially if you’re traveling with family or just need a break. The ride offered commentary on the history and was a fun way to enjoy different views of the fortress.

One unexpected highlight of the day was trying my hand at **traditional Korean archery**! Near the northern section of the fortress wall, there’s an archery range where you can take a quick lesson. For a small fee, I got to shoot a few arrows, and let’s just say I have a new appreciation for historical warriors. Even though I wasn’t very good, it was a fun experience that added a bit of adventure to my historical journey.

## Evening - Sunset at Hwahongmun Gate

As the day was winding down, I made my way to **Hwahongmun Gate**, one of the most picturesque parts of the fortress. This gate is built over a stream with arched stone bridges underneath, creating a beautiful reflection in the water. It’s especially breathtaking at sunset, as the light hits the arches and reflects in the stream below.

I found a quiet spot nearby and just enjoyed the peacefulness of the evening. Watching the sky change colors over this historic site was the perfect way to end my day at Hwaseong Fortress.

## Final Tips for Visiting Suwon Hwaseong Fortress

1. **Wear comfortable shoes** - There’s a lot of walking involved, especially if you want to explore the full fortress wall.
2. **Bring a camera** - With stunning views at every turn, Hwaseong Fortress is a photographer’s dream.
3. **Check out the Hwaseong Trolley and archery range** for a unique experience that adds to the historic atmosphere.
4. **Consider visiting on a weekday** to avoid the weekend crowds, especially in popular spots like Hwahongmun Gate.

Suwon Hwaseong Fortress is more than just a historical site – it’s a place where Korea’s past and present come together, offering a perfect day trip from Seoul filled with history, culture, and adventure.
